                        <h4> Brief Historical Background</h4>
                        <p>The origin of the Municipality is unfolded from the legends and fables of the old
                            generation.
                            In 1578 when the head Mission of Quipayo was established, Calabanga was only a
                            visita or
                            barrio. At that time, the place has vast forests and swamps and an abundance of
                            wildlife
                            such as monkeys, wild chickens and forest lizards. Some say Calabanga derived its
                            name
                            from the Bicol word “Calabangan”, the plural term of “labang” or “litag”, a kind of
                            snare
                            for
                            catching wild animals. Another legend says that Calabanga originated from the word
                            “Calagbangan” meaning the wide, long and straight street spanning from the church
                            through
                            the poblacion, east to west, called locally as “Calabaan” or “Calacbangan”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Calabanga became a town with 400 tributes. On July 15, 1749, it was separated from
                            Quipayo
                            by virtue of the approval of Don Fray Joan de Arechera, Bishop-elect of Nueva
                            Segovia of
                            the
                            Commissary of the King, in the petition signed and filed by 37 Calabangueños on
                            April
                            28,
                            1749 for the town to be conveniently administered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There were two visitas- Visita de Cagapad and Visita de Hinarijan and 12 barrios.
                            The
                            barrios were San Antonio, San Vicente, Sta Catalina, Nuestra Señora de Salud, San
                            Lucas,
                            San
                            Miguel, Sta. Isabel, Nuestra Señora del Carmen, San Roque, San Pablo, San Jose (now
                            Balongay) and Belen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, Calabanga is one of the Municipalities of the Province of Camarines Sur. With
